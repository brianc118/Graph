# GRAPH
Graphing / plotting libary for Arduino.

### Why use this
The graphing library is suited for real time plotting of data (such as sensor data). Histograms / scatter / line graphs are currently implemented. It is fast and flexible, but *not complete*.

Compatible displays:
- ILI9341
- others?

### Motivation
This project originally began when I was building my reflow oven in early 2016.
